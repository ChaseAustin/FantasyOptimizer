# FantasyOptimizer
Lineup Optimizer for NBA FanDuel DFS. 



This optimizer works by pulling data from several basketball stats websites. Each of the tables pulled is stored as a class in scrapingClasses.py. The links for every html used are stored in scraping_links.txt




I'm Still working on the scripting for each of the classes in scriptingClasses.py and I will track my progress here.
